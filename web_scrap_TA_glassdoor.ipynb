Acted like a know-it-all even though she had no clue about US laws. Some co-workers were equally nasty and toxic. Overall environment very hostile and stressful. There is no safety culture, professionalism, training and tact at all; You will be harassed constantly for doing your job correctly/quietly/following federal laws. Other people's sole responsibilities become yours in addition to your responsibilities leaving you constantly overwhelmed (even on your days off you are harassed). Countless times U.S safety guidelines were violated so that the flight can leave on time; don't understand how or why passengers fly on this carrier as safety procedures were constantly violated (ADA especially). One co-worker who opened the JFK station in early 90s was forced to stand on the ramp in the freezing sub-zero temperatures and freezing rain after receiving chemotherapy as a result of being diagnosed with cancer and was eventually fired. SM made fun of other staff because of their weight/appearance (not professional at all). One duty involved monitoring the ramp and the SM would force staff to stand very close in front of the engine (even though there are safety cones there for a reason; she demanded you stand even closer/past the safety cones); if the pilot accidentally started the engine while conducting their tests before boarding, you're finished. One time on a very hot summer day (90 degrees Fahrenheit), the cleaner fainted on the hot plane parked on the tarmac and the SM didn't want to turn on the A/C (other carriers did) to save money. As mentioned above, service partner staff who do so much for the carrier were treated like garbage. There are other countless incidents that happened that make you wonder how this carrier continues to fly here in US despite countless violations (maybe they bribe the FAA as SQ/Singapore, as stingy as they are, are rich and sadly money is all that matters today to these corrupt organizations even if principles/laws are violated). Training is non-existent (the same system used here was learned from working at a true world-class international airline which I left due to being part-time only and very soon regretted leaving to come here; I really learned nothing working here except that this experience was a living hell). Yes, nasty passengers are everywhere but SQ has some of the most disgusting, nastiest passengers you could ever deal with. Even one passenger told me that Qatar is far better (it consistently wins Skytrax airline of the year) than SQ and said that the latter is very cheap (his words, not mine!). Pay is a joke (.07 cents is added to your salary per hour after a year if you're lucky) and flight benefits are equally horrible and useless (can only fly on SQ; no interline agreement at all w/other carriers). Working here is basically indentured servitude or glorified slavery; it destroyed my passion for working in aviation completely and made me leave the industry for good.

            "Cons:  ['The political scene at Singapore Airlines is quite brutal. There is a pecking order where the marketing division calls the shots. The cabin crew division is next most important, and divions that are seen as having supporting roles, like engineering division, are at the bottom of the food chain. \\r\\nThe management in Singapore Airlines are more interested in approportioning blame than solving problems and getting the job done. The management are also very concerned about \"covering ass\", to the extent that it is having very detrimental effects. For example, a lot of managers are starting to not make simple decisions and insisting on senior managers, vice presidents and other higher ranking management making the decision. This takes up a lot of time and does not add any value to the project.\\r\\nThere is also a lot of backstabbing going on.\\r\\nOne of the biggest problems at Singapore Airlines is that it does not matter how good you are at your job - as long as you are favoured by the management, you can do absolutely nothing and still get promoted. The reverse is also true - once you fall out of favour with the management, you will continually be bullied and bypassed for promotion even if you work 80 hour weeks and make no mistakes.\\r\\nThe management is very petty and unreceptive to feedback. Criticism, even when constructive, is taken personally. The management has a record of punishing employees who give feedback that is deemed to be critical of them.', 'Crew are treated as \"just a staff number\". Once you get married & have kids .. The salary is not that great. Management does not empathize with sick crew. Due to a spinal issue I took medical leave a few times a year and was never promoted after 10 years of service.', '- Your body-clock goes haywire\\r\\n- Be prepared to miss out on valuable time with family and friends\\r\\n- Need to work on public holidays when all your peers are having fun\\r\\n- Emotionally and physically taxing\\r\\n- Full of bullies (especially senior crew who are stubborn, inflexible, old-fashioned, and have no idea what they are doing)\\r\\n- Ridiculously slow or non-existent career prospects\\r\\n- Senior management does not review your feedback or concerns.

Layers of management are not often connected to each other towards the same goals besides cost savings.', '- Need to work on Weekends and PH\\r\\n- Irregular work timing \\r\\n- Strict Management \\r\\n- Hierarchical culture', '1. The air travel industry is a sunset industry due to commodisation of airline seats and services. Airlines all buy the same planes and seats from the same manufacturers. There\\'s really no difference travelling SIA or ANA or Emirates now - whichever gets you there the fastest and cheapest gets your business. For shorter distance, LCCs make even more economical sense.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Yes the brand name is strong but do realise that any experience you gain from the airline industry is actually quite specialised due to the nature of the business. If you want to switch jobs in the future you really need to convince your potential employer why you want to crossover. The usual question is \"SIA is such a strong brand name, why do you want to leave?\" a.k.a. \"Is there something wrong with you?\" Also SIA owns SilkAir, Scoot and Tiger - if you quit from SIA you are basically left with smaller airlines to hop to if you want to stay in the same industry.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Rotation policy can be a bane - imagine you are getting good at your job and getting along well with your colleagues and your boss - then you are asked to switch departments. What if you are allocated to somewhere which you don\\'t like or can\\'t get along with your manager? Constant rotating does not instill a sense of security and belonging. Thus there are good people who actually leave after their second or third rotation after a while. Also, as mentioned by some of the contributors, due to the rotation policy it encourages some bad behaviour like people who are too eager to prove themselves as well as not motivated to solve some structural issues because they are only there for a short time.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Due to intensified competition from other airlines and LCCs and high fuel prices, airlines have to cut costs and do more with less resources. You can sense the tension in the air and everyone\\'s afraid of speaking up against management because they are the ones who know best. Gone are the days of 5-6 months bonus, now 1-2 months is the norm. Promotion is slow and it takes an average to above average performer 10 years to reach managerial status from executive.\\r\\n\\r\\n5.

Nothing evolves, processes are clunky and slow and worst of all, the Company is incredibly cheap with its penny-pinching! No opportunity for growth or training and overseas staff are left to fend on their own. The Company is a revolving door, the talent leaves straight away.

Somehow people's faces still light up when you mention the company name. It is arguably one of Singapore's strongest brand name.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.

            "Cons:  ['Narrow perspective on work ethics and cultural integration', 'Long working hours and shifts', \"The company requires full-time staff to serve three months' notice when tendering their resignation.\\r\\n\\r\\nCost saving measures in the back-end are very widespread, which is a stark contrast to the customer-facing premium image that the company projects. For example, I was told that employees do not have a transport allowance despite working after 9pm (bear in mind that the offices are inside a restricted area in the airport's cargo complex), hence those who commute on public transport face a major inconvenience.\", '1. The air travel industry is a sunset industry due to commodisation of airline seats and services. Airlines all buy the same planes and seats from the same manufacturers. There\\'s really no difference travelling SIA or ANA or Emirates now - whichever gets you there the fastest and cheapest gets your business. For shorter distance, LCCs make even more economical sense.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Yes the brand name is strong but do realise that any experience you gain from the airline industry is actually quite specialised due to the nature of the business. If you want to switch jobs in the future you really need to convince your potential employer why you want to crossover. The usual question is \"SIA is such a strong brand name, why do you want to leave?\" a.k.a. \"Is there something wrong with you?\" Also SIA owns SilkAir, Scoot and Tiger - if you quit from SIA you are basically left with smaller airlines to hop to if you want to stay in the same industry.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Rotation policy can be a bane - imagine you are getting good at your job and getting along well with your colleagues and your boss - then you are asked to switch departments. What if you are allocated to somewhere which you don\\'t like or can\\'t get along with your manager? Constant rotating does not instill a sense of security and belonging. Thus there are good people who actually leave after their second or third rotation after a while. Also, as mentioned by some of the contributors, due to the rotation policy it encourages some bad behaviour like people who are too eager to prove themselves as well as not motivated to solve some structural issues because they are only there for a short time.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Due to intensified competition from other airlines and LCCs and high fuel prices, airlines have to cut costs and do more with less resources. You can sense the tension in the air and everyone\\'s afraid of speaking up against management because they are the ones who know best. Gone are the days of 5-6 months bonus, now 1-2 months is the norm. Promotion is slow and it takes an average to above average performer 10 years to reach managerial status from executive.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. The best line I\\'ve read from the reviews here so far and which I agree with - If you have other job offers, do consider them more favourably - unless you are really passionate about air planes and air travel.', 'Conservative mindset of some management', 'Little career progression, frustrating if you are a driven individual, job rotations do not come as promised, very top-down management style, the loudest and not the most talented in the company will stand out.', \"The company culture, I would say it's the most negative side, people there would give you different treatment according to how long you've been working with the company. Company taught their employee to be like that, it's a quite stressful work condition, they will try to push you really hard.\", 'Not forgiving when a mistake is made. Less encouraging to guide the wrongs but quick to peanlise on the decision made when it is concluded as unfavourable.', '- Your body-clock goes haywire\\r\\n- Be prepared to miss out on valuable time with family and friends\\r\\n- Need to work on public holidays when all your peers are having fun\\r\\n- Emotionally and physically taxing\\r\\n- Full of bullies (especially senior crew who are stubborn, inflexible, old-fashioned, and have no idea what they are doing)\\r\\n- Ridiculously slow or non-existent career prospects\\r\\n- Senior management does not review your feedback or concerns.

Not all are bullies.', 'far from my  home town', 'Accommodation is more like a dorm (internal slang: \"jail\"). You are told when and which guests you are allowed to have. You are constantly monitored and you are sharing the apartment with strangers. Your partner/family cannot live with you, and they cannot visit whenever they want. You have to get approval in advance, and there is no flexibility about this.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are always at fault no matter the situation. You tell a passenger to wear the mask (you have to tell them) and the passenger doesn\\'t like this, you get called into the office and be told that it\\'s your fault. \\r\\n\\r\\nYou cannot have opinions and you have to completely hide your emotions, even when going through a tough time. To demonstrate this: during the first few days of training we got showed a video where Katy Perry is crying backstage after her boyfriend broke up with her, and her colleagues are telling her to either this or go home. She decides to perform. The company (Emirates) made the conclusion of this video and told us to hide and push away any personal emotions, even if we are going through a hard time of life. We have to perform on board as if we were artists or singers. Either that or quit. This was the message throughout the whole training.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe training period is hard, because of the constant monitoring, (everything is written down. For example I decided not to drink from bottled water but to use my own bottle to fill up, or drink something else, like premade lemonades etc, For this I was called into the office and had been told that if I don\\'t like bottled water I should think about my choice of job because there is bottled water on the planes.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal space and time is not respected:\\r\\n-I had close loved ones being lost, and I had to go to work and I was forced to smile\\r\\n-I was hit by a passenger and the company told me to get over with and go back to work and smile. I didn\\'t get one or 2 days off, even tho I requested it. \\r\\n\\r\\nYou are always under investigation and surveillance, they note down EVERY single thing you say or do. Even the smallest of things.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was sick (flu), and I had a doctors note, they would call me and forcefully ask me to tell them my exact situation. I refused as it is my privacy, but this is always looked as a bad thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring pandemic we lost 75% of our salaries, and we were on constant standby for months ( every day until 18.00 pm ) without being payed for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe communication style is top to bottom only, whatever you are told, you have to \"take the feedback and reflect on it\" (this phrase is told to everyone all the time). \\r\\n\\r\\nYou cannot be straight forward and honest (while still being respectful) without being seen as rude or misbehaving.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou get punished if you get sick, and you undergo investigations. You are seen as a poor employee.\\r\\n\\r\\n Your health insurance is through the company\\'s own clinic, meaning they keep your health documentation very close, and you don\\'t have another way to use your healthcare coverage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole company culture is very negative and they have a very strong blame culture. The positive appearance of the company is just that: appearance.\\r\\n\\r\\nPromotion is a time only basis, they offer promotion only when they need people, and your performance as an employee has no effect on it. This leads to unqualified leaders who have very poor management skills, and very talented employees being pushed aside on a regular. At the time of writing the expected promotion from economy class to business class is 6+ years. In comparison there are seniors on board who got promoted to leadership roles within few years (not because their skills but because the need of the time). Therefore they are lacking the overview of the job of their teams, and become poor managers.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou never feel valued. There is no humane communication ( for example before firing during pandemic, or even when cutting or giving bonuses, salaries, accommodation money, family support, etc). \\r\\n\\r\\nBonuses are very rare and delivered in a rude manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou have to move to Dubai if you want the job. Zero flexibility about this.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company is not flexible regarding anything (free time, sickness, important life events, hard times in life, pregnancy, accidents, etc.). You most likely wont get the holidays you want ( about 50-75% of the time).\\r\\n\\r\\nHR is not there to support with actually human resource issues (harassment etc). Their only role is to tell you where to find information regarding pay, insurance or spending claims.', 'Long hours of working. Waking up really early. Jet lag. Bad working conditions for health.

Essentially, don\\'t be fooled by the allure of flying and working for Emirates that\\'s projected on social media – it\\'s all smoke and mirrors and in reality, as others have mentioned, there\\'s a dark side to working there that you don\\'t see from the outside. EK operates with a cult-like mentality and is weighed down by incompetent, disconnected management that only knows how to lead with fear and punishment, which trickles down to an increasing amount of senior crew who abuse their position of authority. I may have been fortunate to meet and work with a handful of the most incredible colleagues and supervisors, but that doesn\\'t negate the toxic reporting and backstabbing culture that pervades the entire crew community because of a few bad apples. No matter how loyal, hardworking, or how many years you dedicate to the company, EK will toss you out without even batting an eye because you\\'re only just a number to them – this was made glaringly evident by the way the company treated thousands of crew who lost their jobs during the pandemic. It was honestly sad to see how apathetic and miserable a lot of crew were, but it\\'s not always easy for people to leave. If you value a healthy work environment, career progression, and the ability to think for yourself, stay far away. In addition:\\r\\n\\r\\n- You\\'ll occasionally be forced to operate flight duties and rest periods that would be considered 100% illegal by FAA standards. EK is owned by the government, so GCAA can bend the legalities as they wish. Brutal SIN turnarounds and 24-hour layovers in JFK and IAH with minimum on-board rest are legal, yet the same company logic requires you to be in Dubai after your (minimal) leave up to 3 days before your next duty in order to \"acclimatize.\" It\\'s all about control.\\r\\n- Due to the tough lifestyle and physical nature of the job, it can inevitably take a toll on your health and immunity. Crew are harshly punished for sickness, and many are afraid to call in sick for fear of losing their job. It\\'s a vicious cycle.\\r\\n- Company micromanages and treats crew like children, restricting your every move. For the longest time, crew were not allowed any visitors in company-provided accommodation even when all related COVID restrictions were lifted in Dubai. Employees grovel to the company for basic rights and the response is always, \"If you don\\'t like it, then leave.\" Also, company personnel can enter your apartment and room without informing you first, when you\\'re gone, or even while you\\'re sleeping, which is a terrible invasion of privacy. \\r\\n- Image and Uniform policing that borderlines harassment where every aspect of your weight, body shape, and appearance will be micromanaged and even outright insulted. \\r\\n- Severe cost-cutting measures, such as no more paid recurrent training and lower per diem allowances, yet the company somehow has more than enough money to promote lavish social media campaigns and sponsorships. Forget about any 401(k)/pension plan. Since the company hasn\\'t been performing well these past few years even before COVID, there are no annual bonuses or salary increases either.\\r\\n- Not necessarily EK-specific and this is my own personal opinion, but I found Dubai to be a very fake, materialistic, and lonely place.

Women were often promoted based on appearance, and also often downgraded based solely on gender (in one department, during one of the many \"restructurings\" 70% of the downgrades were women. One woman with a Doctorate and another with a Masters from one of the world\\'s most prestigious universities - both of whom had 15+ years of experience - were downgraded to one level above a senior chauffer. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pay is mediocre unless you are at the top. And you cannot be sure the pay will stay what it is when you join, in case you get caught up in one of the \"transformations\" Changing teams and moving upwards is exclusively about who likes you. I saw management actively block moves to a better position on a different team because they did not like the person who was moving. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEmirates staff are always exhausted and always bitter. This is not limited to one team or one department, it is very nearly across the board. I have been through some really hard things in my life, but I left 2 years ago and am still undoing the damage that place did to my psyche. Do not join.

Even their wives and family receive a full coverage, while cabin crew (who is the most exposed to health risks!) gets only the most basic health insurance that doesn’t cover anything besides visits to the EK Clinik!

That story correlates well with the two FlyDubai pilots who crashed the 737 in Russia:  both their wives were pregnant, so a colleague started a donation fund for them, which did quite well.

Promotion within the company will depend on need and not performance.\", 'Management (in my department)', 'Rotainal shift \\r\\nVery Slow growth', 'Bad management  and hard schedule', \"1. Extremely compartmentalized work environment.\\r\\n2. Excessive number of staff who've been around for over 20-30 years, so a work environment where people are often very set in their ways and highly resistant to change.\\r\\n3. Corporate culture of passing the blame and political strong arming. Extremely hard to find people willing to come together to improve things because they're often blocked by someone else's agendas.\\r\\n4. Staff benefits are OVER-HYPED. Cheap flights often involve hours of waiting with no certainty and staff are prioritized lower than cargo.\\r\\n5. Blatant racism in hiring procedures; eg - a UAE national with a college degree and next-to-zero experience will start at the same level as an expat with post graduate degrees, 5+ years of experience, multiple industry specific certifications; and still be paid 2-3 times more.\\r\\n6. Mistaking loyalty for complacency - a large number of staff have been in the organization for 10+ years doing the exact same thing and are very comfortable not trying to improve.\\r\\n7. Hierarchical approach to promotion - often it's not the best candidate for the role that is promoted but the person who's been around the longest with the better connections even if they are unsuited for the role.\\r\\n8. Poor staff development initiatives - very small programs such as SPARK which are highly restrictive and appraisals are merely seen as a formality with little to no initiative by managers to develop staff. They are often treated as a necessary evil as opposed to a fulfilling means to building up talent and allowing them to reach their potential.\\r\\n9. Deeply ingrained work cliques and political divides. Departmental competition is not for driving improvement and progress but rather as a means to assign blame to others.\\r\\n10. The Gulf's tendency to censor - being a monarchy, freedom of expression is extremely controlled. Despite facing a massive recession, the company and the country it represents will censor any and all information which could potentially paint them in a poor light. Make no mistake, the company is run through government decree and will call itself wholly private when convenient and put on its governmental hat when it suits its needs.\\r\\n11. Low chances for learning new technology - they are often several years other market leaders and prefer to bring in already trained specialists than train their own people. Working in the company for an extended period will guarantee diminished skills.\\r\\n12. Be ready for nepotism - you will find a lot of people & their relatives working there. Hiring is often for friends & family, over skills and experience.\\r\\n13.  Accommodation promises are often unfounded. While it might be implied that you could potentially get free or discounted accommodation; the practicality is that the wait times are several years.\\r\\n14. Extremely poor work-life balance - the nature of the work is demanding at the best of times. In the current economic climate, the region is struggling financially and it tends to bring out the worst in human nature. Be prepared for staff being terrified of losing their jobs and the organization subtlely using it squeeze more out of them.\\r\\n15.  Poor salary increments & annual bonuses - Increments can often be 0% but I've seen 0.3-1% increases more. Annual bonuses can vary greatly and the salary split (basic + accomodation + *transport) means that what you're actually getting is a lot less than you're actually earning.\\r\\n16. Three year improvement cycles - They launch refresh cycles every 2-3 years, with new branding each time. Essentially it's a fresh initiative to streamline operations and improve the company; sadly the only thing that consistently happens is that the cliques protect each other and the people who are actively trying to make improvements and challenge the status quo are the ones being made redundant or replaced. The old cliche of 'the more things change, the more they stay the same', rings extremely true here.\\r\\n 17.  Corporate purchases can sometimes be done for under-the-table reasons. eg - HP had a mutli-million $ deal with Emirates IT even though their tool set was utterly useless unsatisfactory for the use cases but never the less several packages were purchased and most never even used. Be prepared to use packages that are outdated and ineffective because it's been shoved down your throat.\\r\\n18. Extremely spoiled staff - you will find staff extremely inflexible in their habits. If implementing even new tech and offerings, expect a lot of frustration, time and money to be put into making the new applications look and feel like the older ones for zero benefit.   \\r\\n19. Mix of in-house and 3rd party applications - Notoriously difficult mix of in-house, 3rd party and vendor applications with an insane amount of inter-dependencies and unsupported formats. Often applications exist merely to translate information from an ancient application(that no one can support) to another intermediary application which then feeds it to another system to uses the data.\\r\\n20. Lack of high-quality managers and management team - you'll find a lot of people who've been promoted internally who lack the skills to be effective people managers and have been promoted purely on technical aptitude & time in the company. If you're looking for good mentors and a management team that can see the big picture, you could be left unsatisfied.\\r\\n21. Extremely reactive work environment - Especially in IT, you'll see corners cut for testing and deployment and will often see packages and upgrades rolled out that turn up creating new issues. It's the cycle that sustains the work flow, the people that are responsible to create and maintain the applications end up justifying their presence by bungled software launches; made worse through poor project management and forced deadlines from corporate and seriously restrictive budgets. You will spend the majority of your time here firefighting.\\r\\n22. The region is dying - since 2015 there has been a steady decline in oil revenue and a massive reduction in tourists from North America and Europe.

NEVER BELIEVE in them.\\r\\n- Divide and rule... one of their policies.\\r\\netc...', \"After reading the review it appears there has not been any changes in the past 17 years since I left KAL.\\r\\n\\r\\nHome staff are people who come from HQ office in Seoul Korea. They are managers and directors who were selected to manage remote local offices in cities such as San Francisco, LA, and New York. These assignments were given to people who were deemed qualified in their knowledge, education, and English language skills. However in reality\\r\\nmost of these home staff managers and directors are bunch of Korean con artists and thieves.\\r\\nThey cannot speak English nor do they have the management skills to oversee a workforce of over 20 people.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my experience these managers/directors come here thinking they can get away with everything. They are very arrogant and treat local staff employees like slaves and servants. The yelling and demoralization never ceases to amaze me, they would call local staff employees, Gae-se-ki-ya!  and Byung-shin-a! in front of other employees.\\r\\nThere are no HR rules to follow and no HR manager to file a grievance or complaint too. Most of the employees would only stay for a few months and leave after frustration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe home staff managers viewed their tour of duty in areas like San Francisco and Los Angeles as a vacation spot. They would utilize the company and human resources to take care of their wife and kids. Some local staff employees would provide free rides and deliver groceries and packages to the manager's family during company time tothe manager in hopes for promotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn reality the home staff has no intention of giving you anything. Even if the local staff sincerely helped the manager and worked very hard, these idiots  will screw you in the end, for example\\r\\none time the financial statement numbers were way office compared what was projected at the HQ office in Korea. After the manager left and went back to Korea, he blamed the local employees for\\r\\nunauthorized expenses, when in reality the home staff manager was using company money on drinking and paying for illegal activities. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlso the home staff manager/directors manipulated the local office environment by playing dirty politics. He would pit the local full-timers against the part-timers by providing the part-timersan incentive to get promotion to full-time status. The part-timers would act as spies and report everything to the manager.\\r\\n\\r\\nWord of advice: Please do not work here unless you want to learn humiliation, frustration, and get yelled at on regular basis.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm glad i left this company a long time ago. I now live in a 1.5 million dollar house and work at internet technology company making 6 figures. While the part-timers who wanted my job are still working as a full-time employee making less than 50K with bad benefits. LOL.\\r\\nI hope this motivates people working at KAL as a local staff employees to move on to better and bigger things as this company does not care for you or your family!!!!\", 'nothing special. everything was good.', 'Terrible workplace harassment and descrimination against non-Koreans. No workplace values such as respect and diversity. Incredibly unorthodox management hierarchy with unethical values direct from the ruling Cho family. Nut rage, water rage, embezzling and fraud . Terrible and very few benefits. One year contract is all they offer. Lowest salary in the industry. Very high turnover. Everybody not imported quits if they are employable elsewhere.', 'It is like working at a Korean company located in Korea--could be worse than some of them. Will not go a day w/o hearing yelling and seeing the manager\\'s face turn red. Employees will talk bad about each other whenever they can. Korean Air is very stingy. You are literally just there to make the\\r\\ncompany money. Do not expect self growth, you will be disappointed at the lack of trainings available for you. You are expected to know how to do everything without being shown nor taught. And you\\'ll get yelled at for it. To learn anything, you will be expected to watch a video--Very helpful. Yelled at if arrived to work 2 minutes late--while staying after work for 2-3 hours w/o overtime pay is a daily routine. The office is managed hierarchically. You will be in charge of being practically a secretary to a coffee maker, IT person, cleaning after people if you\\'ve just entered. You will address them as \"sunbaenim\". The CEO of the company doesn\\'t care about the employees. Doesn\\'t take much to realize that. Flight benefits are good but unrealistic with vacation days that are accrued only at the end of the year. So if you begin in January, you will not have any vacation days until next January. Pay is low for how much you are required to work, and even after a significant discount on fare, it\\'s really not enough. Unless you work in Korea or LAX, there will not be an HR person in the office to maintain a respected work environment for employees. Power and status is abused by the managers and older/experienced employees. If you are thinking of joining KAL-don\\'t. If you are a current employee-QUIT! There are far better work environments with the same or better pay for you. You will realize people do communicate their thoughts and problems with just words--no yelling and red faces--and much more effectively. Afterall, we\\'re all adults and should be able to communicate without yelling at the top of our lungs.', \"Managers treat you like a slave and basically force you to come out and work over time on your days off. There were many times they made us work morning and night shift and then get 2 hours of sleep and come back out for morning shift and they do not care if we're tired. Pros are free tickets which we are only able to use for 2 weeks max. We have to be back at work by 2 weeks.. And the vacation day starts the day which we leave which makes us only able to go on a vacation for almost 10 days. And once we use the vacation days we're not allowed to request any vacation days for 6 months. -_- Also, the employees are the greatest and biggest gossipers. They LOVE to talk behind everyone's back. And of course the managers gets all the credits for the good stuff that happens and all the mistakes they make is blamed on us. They also like to favor employees. If they like an employee just cause he buys the manager coffee everyday they would promote him up to full time in less than a year when we had employees who were part time for 6 years and she was one of the most hard working employees ever. Sick call? Don't even think about it. One manager said to me if you're able to call in sick you're not dying so I expect to see you at work. Oh. We could only sick call the day we die? This could go on forever but I'll stop here.. Hope you guys get the point.\", 'Still strict Korean culture there is.']\n",
