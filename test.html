            <h3>⚠️ Research Disclaimer</h3>
            <p><strong>Data Sources:</strong> This research uses publicly available review data from Skytrax (customer reviews) and Glassdoor (employee reviews). All data was collected through ethical web scraping practices and publicly available datasets on Kaggle. We respect the terms of service of all platforms and use only publicly accessible information.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Statistical Limitations:</strong> The correlation analysis is based on 10 airlines where both employee and customer data were available in sufficient quantity. The small sample size (n=10) limits statistical power. While we observe a moderate positive correlation (r=0.56, p=0.095), readers should interpret this as suggestive evidence rather than definitive proof of causation. We emphasize effect sizes and confidence intervals rather than relying solely on p-values.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Review Representativeness:</strong> Online reviews represent self-selected samples of employees and customers, potentially skewed toward those with strong opinions. Results may not generalize to all airlines or all customer/employee segments.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Temporal Considerations:</strong> Reviews were collected at different time periods. We aggregated data without strict temporal matching, which may introduce noise into the correlational analysis.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Academic Use:</strong> This work represents exploratory research combining multiple data sources and analytical methods. We welcome feedback and suggestions for refinement.</p>

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
                We investigate the relationship between employee workplace satisfaction and customer service experience in the 
                airline industry by analyzing 42,599 reviews from two independent sources: Glassdoor (9,351 employee reviews) 
                and Skytrax (approximately 33,000 customer reviews). Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, 
                we identified key themes in both employee workplace experiences and customer service perceptions. We then 
                examined whether airlines with higher employee satisfaction also achieve higher customer satisfaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our analysis of 10 major international airlines reveals a moderate positive correlation between employee and 
                customer satisfaction (Pearson r=0.56, p=0.095). Airlines with above-median employee ratings achieved customer 
                satisfaction scores approximately 0.4 points higher (on a 10-point scale) than those with below-median employee 
                ratings (t=2.30, p=0.071). Topic modeling revealed that employee complaints about management quality, career 
                opportunities, and workload predict lower employee ratings (R²=0.063), while customer complaints about delays, 
                refunds, and service quality predict lower customer ratings (R²=0.054).
            </p>
            <p>
                These findings provide empirical support for the service-profit chain theory, suggesting that airlines investing 
                in employee satisfaction may realize benefits in customer satisfaction. However, the small sample size necessitates 
                cautious interpretation and calls for replication with larger datasets.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>1. Introduction and Research Question</h2>
        
        <h3>1.1 Motivation</h3>
        
        <p>
            The airline industry presents a unique context for studying the employee-customer satisfaction relationship. Unlike 
            many service industries, airline employees work in highly constrained environments (aircraft cabins, gate areas) under 
            significant time pressure, often dealing with stressed customers. The quality of service delivery depends heavily on 
            frontline employees—cabin crew, gate agents, ground staff—who directly interface with passengers.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Service management theory, particularly the service-profit chain framework (Heskett et al., 1994), posits that employee 
            satisfaction drives service quality, which in turn drives customer satisfaction and ultimately profitability. Yet empirical 
            evidence for this chain in the airline context remains limited, largely because obtaining both employee and customer data 
            for the same organizations is challenging. Airlines rarely publicize internal employee satisfaction metrics, and even when 
            they conduct surveys, results are proprietary.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The emergence of public review platforms—Glassdoor for employee reviews and Skytrax for customer reviews—creates a new 
            opportunity to test this theoretical relationship using large-scale, authentic data from real employees and customers 
            rather than laboratory surveys.
        </p>
        
        <h3>1.2 Research Question</h3>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Do airlines with higher employee workplace satisfaction achieve higher customer service satisfaction?</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            To answer this question, we needed to:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Collect employee workplace reviews for multiple airlines</li>
            <li>Collect customer flight experience reviews for the same airlines</li>
            <li>Calculate aggregate satisfaction metrics for each airline from both perspectives</li>
            <li>Test whether these metrics correlate</li>
            <li>Identify what specific factors drive employee and customer satisfaction</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>1.3 Contribution</h3>
        
        <p>
            This research makes three contributions:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Methodological:</strong> We demonstrate how publicly available review data can be combined to test organizational 
            hypotheses that previously required access to proprietary internal data.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Empirical:</strong> We provide evidence for the employee-customer satisfaction link using real-world data from 
            42,599 reviews across 497 airlines, substantially larger than typical survey-based studies.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Practical:</strong> We identify specific themes (management quality, career development, workload) that predict 
            employee dissatisfaction and may ultimately affect customer experience, offering actionable insights for airline management.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. Research Design and Methodology</h2>
        
        <p>
            We designed a multi-method research approach combining quantitative analysis (correlation, regression) with qualitative 
            text analysis (topic modeling). This section explains <em>what</em> we did, <em>why</em> we chose each method, and 
            <em>how</em> the pieces fit together.

        </div>
        
        <p>
            Each step was chosen for a specific reason. We'll now explain the methodology for each component.

            <p>
                We needed to understand what employees and customers actually talk about in their reviews. With thousands of text 
                reviews, manual reading isn't feasible. Topic modeling automatically discovers recurring themes in large text corpora.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Why LDA Specifically?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unsupervised:</strong> LDA doesn't require pre-labeled training data, making it ideal for exploratory research</li>
                <li><strong>Interpretable:</strong> LDA produces topics as probability distributions over words, which humans can interpret 
                (e.g., a topic with high probability for "salary," "pay," "compensation" clearly relates to compensation issues)</li>
                <li><strong>Probabilistic:</strong> Unlike simple word clustering, LDA models each document as a <em>mixture</em> of topics, 
                reflecting the reality that a single review often touches on multiple themes</li>
                <li><strong>Standard:</strong> LDA is widely used in organizational research, making our approach comparable to prior studies</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>What LDA Does</h4>
            <p>
                LDA assumes each review is generated by:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>First choosing a mixture of topics (e.g., 60% "management issues," 30% "salary concerns," 10% "travel benefits")</li>
                <li>Then for each word position, choosing a topic from that mixture</li>
                <li>Then choosing a word from that topic's word distribution</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>
                The algorithm works backwards: given the observed words, infer the most likely topic structure that would have generated them.
            </p>
            
            <div class="formula">
Mathematical formulation:

For each document d:
  θd ~ Dirichlet(α)     # topic distribution for document
  
  For each word position n:
    zd,n ~ Multinomial(θd)         # choose topic
    wd,n ~ Multinomial(φzd,n)      # choose word from that topic

Where:
  θd = topic mixture for document d (K-dimensional)
  α = prior controlling topic sparsity (we used α = 50/K)
  zd,n = topic assignment for word n
  wd,n = observed word
  φk = word distribution for topic k (V-dimensional)
  β = prior controlling word sparsity (we used β = 0.01)
  K = number of topics (we tested 5-8 topics)
  V = vocabulary size (~5,000-10,000 unique words)
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Method 2: Regression Analysis — Linking Topics to Ratings</h4>
        
        <div class="methodology-box">
            <h4>Purpose</h4>
            <p>
                After identifying topics, we needed to know: <em>Do these topics actually matter?</em> Does mentioning "poor management" 
                predict lower employee ratings? Does mentioning "lost baggage" predict lower customer ratings?
            </p>
            
            <h4>Why Regression?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quantifies relationships:</strong> Regression coefficients tell us how much ratings change per unit change in topic prevalence</li>
                <li><strong>Controls for other topics:</strong> By including all topics simultaneously, we isolate each topic's unique effect</li>
                <li><strong>Statistical testing:</strong> We get p-values and confidence intervals for each topic's effect</li>
                <li><strong>Model fit metrics:</strong> R² tells us what percentage of rating variance the topics explain</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Employee Rating Model</h4>
            <div class="formula">
Rating_i = β₀ + β₁·ConsTopic1_i + β₂·ConsTopic2_i + ... + β₇·ConsTopic7_i + εi

Where:
  Rating_i = overall employee satisfaction (1-5 scale) for review i
  ConsTopicj_i = prevalence of cons topic j in review i (0-1)
  β₀ = intercept (expected rating when no topics present)
  βⱼ = coefficient for topic j
  εi = random error

We expect:
  β < 0 for all topics (more complaints → lower rating)
  Significant topics have p < 0.05
            </div>
            
            <h4>Customer Rating Model</h4>
            <div class="formula">
Rating_i = β₀ + β₁·NegTopic1_i + β₂·NegTopic2_i + ... + β₇·NegTopic7_i + εi

Where:
  Rating_i = overall customer rating (1-10 scale) for negative reviews
  NegTopicj_i = prevalence of negative topic j in review i
  
Note: We applied this only to negative reviews (rating ≤ 4/10)
to understand what makes bad experiences worse.
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Method 3: Correlation Analysis — Testing the Employee-Customer Link</h4>
        
        <div class="methodology-box">
            <h4>Purpose</h4>
            <p>
                Our central question requires testing whether employee satisfaction correlates with customer satisfaction at the 
                airline level. We aggregated individual reviews to airline means, then tested correlation.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Why Two Correlation Measures?</h4>
            <p>We used both Pearson and Spearman correlations:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Pearson Correlation (r):</strong></p>
            <div class="formula">
r = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / √[Σ(xi - x̄)² · Σ(yi - ȳ)²]

Where:
  xi = mean employee rating for airline i
  yi = mean customer rating for airline i
  x̄, ȳ = overall means across all airlines
  
Interpretation:
  r = +1: perfect positive linear relationship
  r = 0: no linear relationship
  r = -1: perfect negative linear relationship
  
Assumptions:
  - Linear relationship
  - Bivariate normality
  - No extreme outliers
            </div>
            
            <p><strong>Spearman Correlation (ρ):</strong></p>
            <div class="formula">
ρ = 1 - [6Σdi²] / [n(n² - 1)]

Where:
  di = difference between ranks of xi and yi
  n = number of airlines (10 in our case)
  
Why use this too?
  - Non-parametric (no distributional assumptions)
  - Robust to outliers
  - Detects monotonic relationships (not just linear)
  - More appropriate for small samples
            </div>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Rationale for using both:</strong> With only n=10 airlines, normality assumptions are difficult to verify. 
                Pearson is more powerful if assumptions hold; Spearman is safer if they don't. Agreement between the two strengthens 
                confidence in the result.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Method 4: T-Test for Group Comparison</h4>
        
        <div class="methodology-box">
            <h4>Purpose</h4>
            <p>
                To provide an intuitive comparison, we split airlines into "high employee satisfaction" (above median) and "low 
                employee satisfaction" (below median) groups, then tested whether customer ratings differed.
            </p>
            
            <div class="formula">
Independent Samples T-Test:

t = (x̄₁ - x̄₂) / √[(s₁²/n₁) + (s₂²/n₂)]

Where:
  x̄₁ = mean customer rating for high-employee-satisfaction airlines
  x̄₂ = mean customer rating for low-employee-satisfaction airlines
  s₁², s₂² = sample variances in each group
  n₁, n₂ = sample sizes (5 airlines in each group)
  
Degrees of freedom: df = n₁ + n₂ - 2 = 8

Decision rule:
  If |t| > critical value (t₀.₀₅,₈ = 2.306), reject null hypothesis
  
Effect size (Cohen's d):
  d = (x̄₁ - x̄₂) / spooled
  where spooled = √[((n₁-1)s₁² + (n₂-1)s₂²) / (n₁+n₂-2)]

        <h3>2.3 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Pipeline</h3>
        
        <p>
            Raw review data required systematic cleaning before analysis. We implemented a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline.
        </p>
        
        <div class="workflow">
            <h4>Algorithm 1: Airline Name Standardization</h4>
            <div class="formula">
<strong>Input:</strong> Raw airline names from multiple sources
<strong>Output:</strong> Standardized canonical airline names

<strong>Procedure:</strong>
1. Create mapping dictionary:
   "Emirates Airlines" → "emirates"
   "Singapore Airlines" → "singapore airlines"  
   "All Nippon Airways" → "ana"
   "ANA" → "ana"
   "Air France" → "france"
   "Qatar Airways" → "qatar"
   ... (100+ mappings)

2. For each review r:
   a. Extract airline name: name_raw = r.airline
   b. Convert to lowercase: name_lower = name_raw.lower()
   c. Lookup in dictionary: name_canonical = mapping[name_lower]
   d. If not in dictionary:
      - Use fuzzy matching (>90% similarity)
      - Manual verification for ambiguous cases
   e. Update review: r.airline = name_canonical

3. Validate:
   - Check all names map to valid canonical forms
   - Verify no orphaned airline names
   - Confirm merge compatibility across datasets

<strong>Why this matters:</strong> Different data sources use different naming 
conventions. Without standardization, "Emirates" and "Emirates Airlines" 
would be treated as separate carriers, preventing proper aggregation.

        </div>
        
        <div class="workflow">
            <h4>Algorithm 2: Duplicate Detection and Removal</h4>
            <div class="formula">
<strong>Input:</strong> Combined reviews from multiple sources
<strong>Output:</strong> Deduplicated review dataset

<strong>Procedure:</strong>
1. Define duplicate key:
   key = (airline_name, review_date, review_text)

2. Exact match removal:
   For each review r in dataset:
     a. Compute key_r = (r.airline, r.date, r.text)
     b. If key_r in seen_keys:
        - Mark r as duplicate
        - Remove r from dataset
     c. Else:
        - Add key_r to seen_keys
        - Keep r

3. Fuzzy duplicate detection (for near-duplicates):
   For each remaining review r:
     a. Compute text_hash = hash(r.text)
     b. For each previous review p with same airline and similar date:
        - Calculate similarity = cosine_similarity(r.text, p.text)
        - If similarity > 0.95:
          * Mark r as near-duplicate
          * Remove r
          * Break

4. Report:
   - Original count: N_original
   - Exact duplicates removed: N_exact
   - Fuzzy duplicates removed: N_fuzzy
   - Final count: N_final = N_original - N_exact - N_fuzzy

<strong>Result:</strong> Reduced customer reviews from ~35,000 raw to ~33,000 unique

            <h4>Algorithm 3: Missing Data Handling</h4>
            <div class="formula">
<strong>Input:</strong> Review with potentially missing fields
<strong>Output:</strong> Decision (keep/exclude) and imputation where appropriate

<strong>Employee Reviews:</strong>
For each employee review r:
  Required fields:
    - overall_rating (1-5)
    - At least one of: pros_text OR cons_text
  
  If r.rating is missing:
    → Exclude review (cannot analyze without dependent variable)
  
  If r.pros is missing AND r.cons is missing:
    → Exclude review (no text to analyze)
  
  If r.pros is missing but r.cons exists:
    → Keep review, set pros = empty string

<strong>Customer Reviews:</strong>
For each customer review r:
  Required fields:
    - overall_rating (1-10)
  
  If r.overall_rating is missing:
    → Exclude review

            <h4>Algorithm 4: Text Preprocessing for Topic Modeling</h4>
            <div class="formula">
<strong>Input:</strong> Raw review text (string)
<strong>Output:</strong> Cleaned token list suitable for LDA

<strong>Procedure:</strong>
For each review text T:

  STEP 1: Tokenization
    tokens = split(T, delimiters=[space, punctuation])
    Example: "Great flight! Very comfortable." 
          → ["Great", "flight", "!", "Very", "comfortable", "."]

  STEP 2: Lowercase conversion
    tokens = [t.lower() for t in tokens]
    Example: ["Great", "flight"] → ["great", "flight"]

  STEP 3: Punctuation removal
    tokens = [t for t in tokens if t.isalpha()]
    Example: ["great", "flight", "!"] → ["great", "flight"]

  STEP 4: Number removal
    tokens = [t for t in tokens if not t.isdigit()]
    Example: ["flight", "123", "delayed"] → ["flight", "delayed"]

  STEP 5: Stopword removal
    stopwords = {"the", "is", "a", "an", "and", "or", ...}
    tokens = [t for t in tokens if t not in stopwords]
    Example: ["the", "flight", "was", "great"] → ["flight", "great"]

  STEP 6: Short word removal
    tokens = [t for t in tokens if len(t) >= 3]
    Example: ["a", "big", "jet"] → ["big", "jet"]

  STEP 7: Lemmatization
    For each token t:
      t_lemma = lemmatize(t)  # Convert to base form
    Example: ["flying", "flies", "flew"] → ["fly", "fly", "fly"]

  STEP 8: Build vocabulary
    Count document frequency for each term
    Remove if:
      - Appears in < 5 documents (too rare, likely noise)
      - Appears in > 90% of documents (too common, no discriminative power)
    
  STEP 9: Final token list
    Return: cleaned_tokens = [t1, t2, t3, ...]

<strong>Example transformation:</strong>
Input:  "The flight was GREAT! Flying with Emirates is amazing."
Output: ["flight", "great", "fly", "emirates", "amazing"]

<strong>Final vocabulary sizes:</strong>
- Employee pros corpus: ~6,500 unique terms
- Employee cons corpus: ~7,200 unique terms  
- Customer review corpus: ~9,800 unique terms

        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
            <h4>💡 Why These Cleaning Steps Matter</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Standardization:</strong> Without it, we can't merge data across sources or aggregate to airline level.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Deduplication:</strong> Prevents over-counting and bias toward frequently-duplicated reviews.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Missing data handling:</strong> Ensures we use maximum available information without introducing bias 
                through improper imputation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Text preprocessing:</strong> LDA requires clean token lists. Stopwords and punctuation add noise without 
                meaning. Lemmatization groups related words (fly/flying/flew) so LDA sees them as the same concept.

        <h3>2.4 Why Employee Reviews Have One Overall Rating</h3>
        
        <div class="note">
            <h4>Understanding Glassdoor Data Structure</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Question:</strong> Why do employee reviews have only one rating when customer reviews have multiple detailed ratings?
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Answer:</strong> This reflects how each platform structures reviews:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Glassdoor (Employee Reviews):</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>One overall rating (1-5 stars):</strong> "How satisfied are you working here overall?"</li>
                <li><strong>Free-text pros:</strong> "What do you like about working here?" (qualitative)</li>
                <li><strong>Free-text cons:</strong> "What could be improved?" (qualitative)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                So employees provide <strong>one numerical rating</strong> and <strong>two text fields</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Skytrax (Customer Reviews):</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>One overall rating (1-10 stars)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Multiple detailed ratings (1-5 stars each):</strong> seat comfort, cabin service, food, entertainment, 
                ground service, WiFi, value for money</li>
                <li><strong>Free-text review:</strong> Detailed description of experience</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                So customers provide <strong>one overall rating + multiple detailed ratings + text</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>For our analysis:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>We used the <strong>overall rating (1-5)</strong> as the dependent variable in employee regression</li>
                <li>We used <strong>LDA on pros/cons text</strong> to identify what drives that rating</li>
                <li>We used the <strong>overall rating (1-10)</strong> as the dependent variable in customer regression</li>
                <li>We used <strong>LDA on review text</strong> to identify complaint themes</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>3. Data Collection</h2>
        
        <p>
            We needed data from two sources: employee workplace reviews and customer flight experience reviews. This section 
            details how we obtained each dataset.
        </p>
        
        <h3>3.1 Employee Reviews from Glassdoor</h3>
        
        <h4>Data Source</h4>
        <p>
            We obtained employee review data from Glassdoor, the world's largest platform for employee workplace reviews. Glassdoor 
            hosts anonymous reviews from current and former employees across all industries.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Collection Method</h4>
        <p>
            Direct web scraping of Glassdoor proved infeasible due to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Login requirements for viewing full reviews</li>
            <li>Strong anti-bot detection mechanisms</li>
            <li>Rate limiting and IP blocking</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Instead, we utilized a publicly available Kaggle dataset containing 850,000 Glassdoor employee reviews across all industries. 
            We filtered this dataset to extract airline-specific reviews by:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Creating a comprehensive list of 100+ airline company names</li>
            <li>Using regex pattern matching to identify airline employers in the company field</li>
            <li>Manually validating matches to ensure accuracy</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>3.2 Customer Reviews from Skytrax</h3>
        
        <h4>Data Source</h4>
        <p>
            We collected customer reviews from Skytrax (airlinequality.com), the world's premier airline review platform. Skytrax 
            features verified customer reviews with detailed ratings across multiple service dimensions.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Collection Methods</h4>
        <p>
            We employed two complementary approaches:
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Approach 1: Web Scraping</strong></p>
        <p>
            We developed Python scripts using requests and BeautifulSoup to scrape reviews directly from Skytrax. Key features:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Parallel processing with 20-25 concurrent workers</li>
            <li>Automatic retry logic (3 attempts per failed request)</li>
            <li>Checkpoint saving every 10 airlines to prevent data loss</li>
            <li>Random delays (0.3-1.5 seconds) between requests to respect server load</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This yielded approximately 10,000 customer reviews across 69 airlines.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Approach 2: Kaggle Dataset</strong></p>
        <p>
            To expand coverage, we downloaded a pre-existing Skytrax dataset from Kaggle containing 23,171 reviews across 497 airlines. 
            This provided:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Broader airline coverage</li>
            <li>Historical reviews no longer available on the website</li>
            <li>Already cleaned and formatted data</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Dataset Merging</strong></p>
        <p>
            We combined both sources and removed duplicates based on airline + review text + date, yielding approximately 33,000 
            unique customer reviews.

        <p>
            We applied LDA separately to four text corpora to understand what employees and customers discuss in their reviews.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Employee "Pros" Themes (What Employees Appreciate)</h4>
        
        <p>
            LDA identified 5-7 recurring themes in employee positive feedback:

        <div class="methodology-box">
            <h4>Topic 1: Compensation and Travel Benefits</h4>
            <p><strong>Top words:</strong> salary, pay, benefits, staff travel, free tickets, discounts, accommodation</p>
            <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Employees value competitive compensation packages and the substantial travel perks 
            that come with airline employment, particularly standby flight privileges.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="methodology-box">
            <h4>Topic 2: Brand Prestige and Reputation</h4>
            <p><strong>Top words:</strong> company, best airline, world-class, brand, reputation, proud, leading</p>
            <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Working for prestigious airlines like Singapore or Emirates carries intrinsic value 
            beyond compensation. Employees take pride in representing well-regarded brands.</p>
        </div>

            <p><strong>Top words:</strong> travel, world, destinations, lifestyle, experience, adventure, cities</p>
            <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The opportunity to travel globally and experience different cultures attracts many 
            employees to airline work, offsetting other challenges.</p>

            <h4>Key Finding: Topic-Rating Relationship</h4>
            <p>
                Employee complaints about management quality, workload, career opportunities, and compensation significantly predict 
                lower overall satisfaction ratings. The regression model explains approximately 6% of variance in individual employee 
                ratings (R²=0.063), which is meaningful given the many personal factors affecting workplace satisfaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                All four major complaint topics showed highly significant negative coefficients (p < 0.001), indicating these are 
                consistent patterns across thousands of reviews, not random noise.

        </table>
        
        <p>
            Regression analysis showed that different complaint types predict different levels of severity in negative reviews 
            (R²=0.054). While all these issues drive down ratings, the model explains modest variance because many other factors 
            (personal expectations, travel circumstances) also influence customer ratings.

            <strong>Observations:</strong> Airlines with higher employee satisfaction (Singapore 3.95, Qantas 3.88, Emirates 3.85) 
            generally achieve higher customer satisfaction (Singapore 8.99, Qantas 8.23, Emirates 8.69). Conversely, airlines with 
            lower employee satisfaction (ANA 3.05, Korean 3.08) show lower customer satisfaction (ANA 8.26, Korean 8.38).

            <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
            <p>
                Both correlations are moderate-to-large in magnitude (0.45-0.56), indicating a meaningful positive relationship. 
                However, neither reaches conventional statistical significance (p < 0.05). This is entirely expected with n=10: 
                to achieve p < 0.05, we would need r ≈ 0.63 or higher.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Statistical Power:</strong> With n=10 and α=0.05, power to detect r=0.56 is approximately 50%. To achieve 
                80% power (standard threshold), we would need approximately 23 airlines. The moderate p-values reflect sample size 
                constraints, not absence of a relationship.

            <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
            <p>
                Airlines with above-median employee satisfaction achieve customer ratings 0.41 points higher on average. While the 
                p-value (0.071) is marginally non-significant, the effect size is large (d = 0.97), indicating substantial practical 
                significance. In the airline industry, where ratings cluster tightly, a 0.4-point advantage is economically meaningful.

                10 airlines.</strong> The visual pattern shows general alignment: airlines with higher employee bars tend to have 
                higher customer bars. Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways excel on both metrics, while ANA and Korean Air show 
                lower scores on both.

                customer rating (y-axis) across 10 airlines.</strong> Each point represents one airline. The upward-sloping trend 
                line illustrates the moderate positive correlation (r = 0.56). While points don't fall perfectly on the line, the 
                general pattern is clear.

                The heatmap shows moderate positive correlation between employee ratings and customer positive ratings (teal), and 
                weak negative correlation between employee ratings and customer negative ratings (darker blue). This suggests that 
                better employee satisfaction associates with both higher positive ratings and fewer negative ratings.

            <h4>Summary of Core Finding</h4>
            <p>
                We find evidence of a moderate positive relationship between employee workplace satisfaction and customer service 
                satisfaction (r = 0.56, p = 0.095). While the small sample (n=10) limits statistical power, the effect size is 
                substantial: airlines with above-median employee satisfaction achieve customer ratings approximately 0.4 points 
                higher (t = 2.30, p = 0.071, Cohen's d = 0.97).
            </p>
            <p>
                This finding aligns with service-profit chain theory and suggests that airlines investing in employee satisfaction 
                may realize benefits in customer satisfaction. However, the correlational nature of this analysis prevents causal 
                claims. Other factors (fleet quality, route networks, pricing strategies) also influence customer satisfaction.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>5. Discussion and Implications</h2>
        
        <h3>5.1 Theoretical Contribution</h3>
        
        <p>
            Our findings provide empirical support for the employee-customer satisfaction link in the airline context using 
            large-scale review data rather than traditional surveys. The moderate correlation (r = 0.56) is consistent with 
            meta-analytic estimates from other service industries (r ≈ 0.40-0.60), suggesting the relationship generalizes to 
            airlines despite their unique operational characteristics.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The topic modeling results reveal specific mechanisms: employee dissatisfaction with management, workload, and career 
            opportunities predicts lower individual ratings, and these organizational issues likely spill over into customer-facing 
            service quality. When employees cite "poor management" and "long hours with short rest," customers experience this as 
            "delays," "boarding chaos," and "inconsistent service."
        </p>
        
        <h3>5.2 Practical Implications</h3>
        
        <p>
            For airline executives, these findings suggest that employee satisfaction initiatives should be viewed not merely as HR 
            programs but as customer satisfaction investments. Specific actionable insights:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Management quality matters:</strong> "Poor management" emerged as the strongest predictor of low employee 
            ratings. Investing in leadership development and management training may yield customer satisfaction dividends.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Workload and scheduling:</strong> Employee complaints about "long hours" and "insufficient rest" suggest 
            that crew scheduling practices affect both employee wellbeing and potentially service quality. More reasonable schedules 
            may improve both metrics.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Career development:</strong> Employees citing "limited growth" and "slow progression" show lower satisfaction. 
            Creating visible career paths may improve retention and service quality.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Monitoring both metrics:</strong> Most airlines track customer satisfaction intensively but treat employee 
            satisfaction as an internal HR metric. The correlation suggests both should appear on the same executive dashboard.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>5.3 Limitations</h3>
        
        <h4>Sample Size</h4>
        <p>
            Our correlation analysis relies on only 10 airlines, limiting statistical power and precluding strong causal claims. 
            While the effect size is meaningful, replication with a larger sample would strengthen confidence.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Selection Bias</h4>
        <p>
            The 10 airlines with robust employee data are all large, established, full-service carriers. Low-cost carriers and 
            regional airlines are underrepresented. Findings may not generalize to different business models.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Review Representativeness</h4>
        <p>
            People who write reviews are self-selected, potentially skewed toward extreme experiences. While large sample sizes 
            (thousands of reviews per airline) mitigate this concern, the possibility of bias remains.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Temporal Misalignment</h4>
        <p>
            We aggregated reviews across time without strict temporal matching. If employee satisfaction changed substantially 
            over the review period, this could introduce noise.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Causality</h4>
        <p>
            Correlation doesn't prove causation. While theory suggests employee satisfaction drives customer satisfaction, the 
            reverse (successful airlines can afford better employee benefits) or third variables (good management improves both) 
            are also plausible.
        </p>
        
        <h3>5.4 Future Research Directions</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Larger sample:</strong> Expanding to more airlines, particularly in underrepresented segments (LCCs, regional 
            carriers), would improve generalizability and statistical power.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Longitudinal analysis:</strong> Tracking how changes in employee satisfaction precede changes in customer 
            satisfaction would provide stronger evidence for causal direction.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Department-specific matching:</strong> Linking cabin crew satisfaction specifically to in-flight service 
            ratings, or ground staff satisfaction to check-in/boarding ratings, would sharpen the analysis.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Control variables:</strong> Including airline characteristics (fleet age, route network, business model) 
            would help isolate the employee-customer relationship from confounding factors.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Cross-industry comparison:</strong> Testing whether this relationship holds in other service sectors 
            (hotels, restaurants, healthcare) would reveal whether findings are airline-specific or broadly applicable.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
        
        <p>
            This research asked whether airlines with higher employee workplace satisfaction also achieve higher customer service 
            satisfaction. Using 42,599 reviews from Glassdoor and Skytrax covering 10 major airlines, we found evidence of a moderate 
            positive relationship (r = 0.56). Airlines with above-median employee satisfaction achieved customer ratings approximately 
            0.4 points higher on a 10-point scale.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Topic modeling revealed that employee complaints about poor management, excessive workload, limited career opportunities, 
            and inadequate compensation significantly predict lower employee ratings. Many customer complaints (delays, service 
            inconsistency, ground service problems) appear to reflect the operational issues employees highlight, suggesting a 
            plausible causal pathway from employee to customer satisfaction.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            While sample size limitations (n=10 airlines) prevent strong causal claims, the pattern is consistent with service-profit 
            chain theory and meta-analytic findings from other industries. Airlines like Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways, which 
            score highly on both employee and customer satisfaction, demonstrate that excellence on both dimensions is achievable.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            For airline managers, the implication is clear: employee satisfaction is not merely an HR concern but a customer service 
            imperative. Investments in management quality, reasonable work schedules, career development, and fair compensation may 
            yield returns not just in retention but in customer loyalty.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We hope this research encourages airlines to monitor both metrics in tandem and motivates further research on the 
            employee-customer satisfaction link using larger samples and longitudinal designs.
